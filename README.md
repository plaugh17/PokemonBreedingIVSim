# PokemonBreedingIVSim
Rough simulation of how IVs and shininess are determined when breeding pokemon in the Pokemon games.
Does not actually calculate values in the same way as in exact same way as in the game but I believe the odds are still roughly the same.
Not particularly user friendly. Just created this to see what would get me the best odds of getting a 6IV pokemon.
Might add IO in the future to make more user friendly. 
Not very well organized either but it gets the job done.
If you want to use it yourself you'll need to have Java installed on your computer. You can change the values at the top of the main() method to set differnet parameters.
